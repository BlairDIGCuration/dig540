I chose the Salt Story Archive as an audio exhibition site example. The website can be searched by media type, ie written, photography, multimedia, or radio. Upon choosing radio, there is the option to search by title and year. The year is based on the year the student was enrolled at Salt. Included in each listing is a short description of the subject matter of the radio piece. Once you select a piece and click on it, you are taken to another page that states the title, year, the creator's name, any contributors, media type, the town it was recorded in, and the county the town is in. The short description is written again as well. There is a 'people' field which is just the name(s) of the subject(s) the radio piece is about, and then there is a 'subjects' field with keywords relating to the location of the story and various subject matters. Below that is the play button to listen to the story, along with a marker with the length of the piece.

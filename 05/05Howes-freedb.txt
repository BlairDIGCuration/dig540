I have added information about the recording locations to the base metadata.  The information has been added to the 
disc table and would include the record 
label and country of recording.  The exhibition will highlight the country of recording and the country of origin 
for the artist so that people can then search by this attribute, which is currently not available in freedb.  
This feature could be important for people searching for music by country of origin.  For example, in Canada, 
rules from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission state that a certain percentage of 
content needs to be at least partially created by people from Canada.  The ability to search by country of origin 
and recording in an online list would be useful in this situation as it means material could be located easily.  
Including the recording location is also important because, according to these rules, the artist does not 
necessarily have to be Canadian, but if it was recorded in Canada then undoubtedly Canadian people would have 
been involved in the creation of the record.  For this example I would start by including my own music collection 
which is very diverse in genre and recording location, but does focus heavily on Canadian artists to begin with.

## Unit 7 - PHP Setup

This video will introduce you to creating and executing a PHP script on Reclaim. Though I mention it a few times in the video, it's important to keep in mind that this unit is mostly about getting the procedures for creating and uploading PHP scripts down-we haven't talked about the PHP language yet, so if you don't understand it then don't worry. However, do feel free to ask questions!

Worth noting: there are two versions of PHP currently in wide use. We will work with PHP5 for this course as it is more widely supported. PHP7 is a more robust language that has some differences from 5 but is compatible with what we'll talk about in this class.

**Videos**

- Running a PHP file on Reclaim: <https://vimeo.com/240078982>

**Resources**

- W3 Schools Intro to PHP: <https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_intro.asp> (note: you don't need this for this assignment, but it may address some questions you have on PHP itself.)
- Output from my version: <http://curating.me/album_data/07-parsealbum.php> (for comparison)

**Assignment**

I want you to recreate the PHP file I walk through in the video in VSC. Then, save and upload it to Reclaim as I do in the video. Synchronize your github so that your 07 directory contains your version of the parsealbum.php file (change the name appropriately) and send me a link so I can see it on the web.

This assignment is due on Wednesday Oct 31 at 11:59PM.

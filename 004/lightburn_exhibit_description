is online exhibition highlights the work of album cover artists in the 20th century. The central focus is the cover art, not the music. Viewers are invited to experience the music through cover art. The primary information focuses on the cover artist. Viewers can view the album with or without the music present. The exhibition will feature key information such as the background history of the artist, the medium or material (paint, photography, drawing, digital rendering etc) the cover was developed in, and the style such as futurism, noir, art nouveau, expressionism, cubism, abstract etc. The exhibition asks the questions: Does the art match the music? How does the music influence the art? Or how does the art influence the music? The exhibition will feature some of the key ground-breaking contributorâ€™s to album cover art such as photographers Man Ray, Richard Avedon, Herb Ritts, Jean-Paul Goude; painters Andy Warhol, Mati Klarwein; graphic artists such as George Hardie. The background database supporting the exhibition will allow searchability of the artists profile: background, style, medium; linking that information to the musical artists they collaborated with.
